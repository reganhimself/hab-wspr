## High altittude ballon tracking via WSPR

The software webscrapes data from wsprnet.org, filter out calls from the balloons and decode additional telemetry. Currently the script supports upload to:

* habhub tracker ( https://tracker.habhub.org/ )
* aprs-fi ( https://aprs.fi ).

There are existing functions to load/save flightdata from csv/wsprnet-archive-files. ( http://wsprnet.org/drupal/downloads )

The protocol for the telemetry is described here:
